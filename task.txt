In this week's assignment, you are asked to correctly write the body of function whose tests are written.

Info:
- Fork the project to your computer.
- Url: https://github.com/hicodersch/js2-week-03-assignment-02
- Change to the folder where the package.json file is located.
- Run the "npm install" command in the terminal.
- After run this command, you see a new folder called â€žnode_modules" in your project directory! Do not be surprised ;)
- Run "npm test" command in terminal.
- You will see that 4 tests failed.
- You should write body of the function in functions.js according to the tests until each test turns into green!

- isTheWordSplit : Have the function 

isTheWordSplit(pArray) read the array of strings stored in 

pArray, which will contain 2 elements: the first element will be a sequence of characters, and the second element will be a long string of comma-separated words, in alphabetical order, that represents a dictionary of some arbitrary length.

For example: 

pArray can be: ["hellocat", "apple,bat,cat,goodbye,hello,yellow,why"].

Your goal is to determine if the first element in the input can be split into two words, where both words exist in the dictionary that is provided in the second input. In this example, the first element can be split into two words: hello and cat because both of those words are in the dictionary.

Your program should return the two words that exist in the dictionary separated by a comma. So for the example above, your program should return hello,cat. There will only be one correct way to split the first element of characters into two words. If there is no way to split string into two words that exist in the dictionary, return the string not possible. The first element itself will never exist in the dictionary
as a real word.

Examples:

Input: ["baseball", "a,all,b,ball,bas,base,cat,code,d,e,quit,z"]
Output: base,ball

Input: ["abcgefd", "a,ab,abc,abcg,b,c,dog,e,efd,zzzz"]Output: abcg,efd 

Criteria:
=============
- 25 points to pass each test.

Delivery Format:
=============
- Create a private repo on Github.
- Add your mentor and courses@hicoders.ch as collaborators.
- Create a new branch and create a Pull Request for your assignment.
- Then turn in the link for the PR on the assignment.

Happy coding!
